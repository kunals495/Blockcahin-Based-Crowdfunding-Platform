## **Overview**  
This project is a decentralized **crowdfunding platform** built on the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages **smart contracts** written in Solidity to ensure transparency, low transaction fees, and greater control for fundraisers and backers. Unlike traditional crowdfunding platforms, this decentralized application (DApp) eliminates the reliance on third-party intermediaries, addressing common criticisms such as high management fees and lack of transparency.

The platform provides an intuitive **React-based frontend** for users to create and browse campaigns, make contributions, and interact with smart contracts using **MetaMask**.


## **Features**  
1. **Decentralized Crowdfunding**:  
   - Enables users to create and manage fundraising campaigns.  
   - Allows backers to contribute funds securely using the Ethereum blockchain.  

2. **Smart Contract Functionality**:  
   - Transparent and immutable campaign logic.  
   - Fundraisers can make withdrawal requests, subject to backer approvals.  

3. **Frontend Interface**:  
   - Intuitive and user-friendly React web application.  
   - Displays active campaigns and their statuses in real-time.  

4. **Blockchain Integration**:  
   - Interaction with the Ethereum blockchain via **Web3.js**.  
   - Transactions are secured through MetaMask.  


## **Tech Stack**
